A place to talk about how you use sound as art/performance.
Or to ask questions so that you can start.
A resource sharing opportunity; to read, watch films together, and listen.
We can organise field trips, like doing location recording around Bradford District.

We meet every third Wednesday of the month at Fuse Art Space.

We are a grassroots, DIY collective experimenting with sound & sound making electronics in an informal sharing and learning environment.
Beginners with no experience but an interest are especially welcomed.

We primarily run make-and-do sessions – think knit & natter but with circuits.

Meetings are on the first Saturday of the month at Fuse Art Space.

**Covid Safety:** The space has hand sanitiser available. There is not much ventilation, but we can open the door to ventilate if we choose.

**Mask wearing will be required.**

*Please be in touch to let us know if you are coming and if you have any questions.*

We are inviting approx 10 people, and many of you will know each other already.
We don't expect that they will all be able to come.
We anticipate there being about 10 people in the space.
We think that is a covid safe number for the space.

#^about1 trim=ends form=markdown
This video shows what we're hoping to make. If you'd like to see this happen too, come help us build it!

#^more trim=ends form=markdown
*We ran a pilot at FUSE Art Space in Rawson Place, Bradford, BD13QQ.*

These workshops are entirely free and we welcome your participation and collaboration in whatever way you choose. You can bring instruments or just yourselves. The participants will mould the shape of the music and the way the workshops develop.

After Christmas we will review the pilot and take the next steps which include plans to initiate the workshops across the district with different leaders.
