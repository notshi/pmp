**Covid Safety:** The space has hand sanitiser available. There is not much ventilation, but we can open the door to ventilate if we choose.

**Mask wearing will be required.**

#^notes2 trim=ends form=markdown
*Please be in touch to let us know if you are coming and if you have any questions.*

We are inviting approx 10 people, and many of you will know each other already.    
We don't expect that they will all be able to come.  
We anticipate there being about 10 people in the space.    
We think that is a covid safe number for the space.

#^notes3 trim=ends form=markdown
The space is not very warm - please wrap up!<br/> 
Tea and coffee making facilities are available.  
The space has a single toilet.  
We start setting up from 1pm, do come early to help if you like.

**Covid:** Should the rules change around Covid we will aim to notify before or early on the day of the events.

#^about trim=ends form=markdown

**Play Music Project** wants to enable all comers to make, compose and improvise music in a collaborative, experimental and supportive environment.

#^about1 trim=ends form=markdown
This video shows what we're hoping to make. If you'd like to see this happen too, come help us build it!

Email caprenter at gmail.com for more information.

#^more trim=ends form=markdown
*We ran a pilot at FUSE Art Space in Rawson Place, Bradford, BD13QQ.*

These workshops are entirely free and we welcome your participation and collaboration in whatever way you choose. You can bring instruments or just yourselves. The participants will mould the shape of the music and the way the workshops develop.

After Christmas we will review the pilot and take the next steps which include plans to initiate the workshops across the district with different leaders.
